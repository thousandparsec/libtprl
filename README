This is a Readline library in C++.
Origanally written for Thousand Parsec.

Requires:
readline5 or higher.


WARNING!!!!
libtprl is *not* even remotely thread safe.  This is bad and I know it.
So be *very* careful about using it in multi-thread environments.

Again:
WARNING: libtprl is NOT thread safe.
